Conclusion 1:
1. We have two readers FileReader and BufferedReader
    where ever reading is required we should use BufferReade, since it is the most advanced
    BufferedReader is used to read character data from a file
2. There three writer FileWriter, BufferedWriter and PrintWriter
    where ever writing is required we should use PrintWriter

Conclusion 2:
In any programming world there are two type
     Character Data                          |                      Binary data
     (text data)                             |
                                             |            e.g. Video file, audio file, pdf file, images,...
                                             |
Note-1: If we want to handle character       | Note-2: If we want to handle binary data then we should go for streams
data we should use "Readers" and "Writer"    | Note-3: If you want to read binary data from a file then we should use File InputStreams
                                             | Note-4: If we want to write binary data to a file we should use File OutputStream
